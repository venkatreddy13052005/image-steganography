Image steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an image file in such a way that the presence of the information is not obvious. Hereâ€™s a brief description of a typical image steganography project:

Project Title: Image Steganography for Secure Data Transmission

Objective: To develop a system that hides confidential data within digital images, ensuring that the data is concealed from unauthorized users while allowing retrieval by authorized parties. 

Key Components:

Encoding Module: Embeds the secret message or data into an image using algorithms that modify the image's pixel values in a way that minimally affects its visual quality. Common methods include Least Significant Bit (LSB) insertion, where the least significant bits of the image pixels are replaced with bits of the secret data.

Decoding Module: Extracts the hidden data from the image. This module reverses the encoding process to retrieve the original message.

User Interface: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to encode and decode messages. This can be a graphical interface or a command-line tool, depending on the project's scope.

Security Features: Implements encryption to further protect the secret data before embedding it into the image. This ensures that even if the stego image is intercepted, the hidden data remains secure.

Performance Evaluation: Assesses the quality of the stego image and the effectiveness of data hiding. Metrics such as image quality and data capacity are evaluated to ensure that the system meets the required standards.

Applications: Secure communication, watermarking, and digital rights management.

This project combines elements of cryptography and image processing to provide a method for secure data transmission.
